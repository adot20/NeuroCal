# NeuroCal
A Neumorphism designed Calculator (Inspired by Online Tutorials- YT)
A fully functioning calculator built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
One can use it with the features or functions available within the calculator.
You can tweak the code and design however you prefer.
It is only made for educational purpose and has nothing to do with any 3rd party relevance.
Have fun! :)
